**PyTorchGeoNodes**

PyTorchGeoNodes is a differentiable module for reconstructing 3D objects from images using interpretable shape programs.
In comparison to traditional CAD model retrieval methods, the use of shape programs for 3D reconstruction allows for
reasoning about the semantic properties of reconstructed objects, editing, low memory footprint, etc. PyTorchGeoNodes
enables gradient-based optimization by introducing a module that translates shape programs designed in Blender, for
example, into efficient PyTorch code.
