**WIP**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at TU Graz. I earned my PhD with distinction under the expert guidance of Professors Friedrich Fraundorfer and Vincent Lepetit. My primary research interests revolve around the advancement of Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques within the realm of 3D Scene Understanding. More precisely, my work delves into the exciting possibilities of creating digital twins for indoor environments, with a specific emphasis on the intricate task of reconstructing 3D objects and structural elements in demanding and complex scenarios.
